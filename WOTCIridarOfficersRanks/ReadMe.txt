[WOTC] Iridar's Cosmetic Rank Replacer

This mod replaces rank names and rank icons for XCOM soldiers. 

[h1]DEFAULT BEHAVIOR[/h1]

By default, the mod replaces rank names and rank icons for XCOM soldiers and faction heros - each faction gets their own set, thematic and immersive.

If you have any officers, such as those from [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1126186107][WOTC] - K's Officer Class[/url][/b] or [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1241073845][WOTC] - K's Officer Class (Alternative)[/url][/b] mods, they will get their own unique set as well. Ranking officer in squad will also be highlighted in [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1122974240]WotC: robojumper's Squad Select[/url][/b].

[h1]MCM CONFIGURATION[/h1]

The mod is very configurable through the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=667104300][b][WotC] Mod Config Menu[/b][/url].

Rank name sets and rank icon sets can be selected separately from each other, so you can mix and match them as you like. You can select global rank name and rank icon sets for whole groups of soldiers, or individually for every soldier class.

The mod includes several icon sets and rank name sets, and more can be added by plugin mods. If any soldiers classes add their own rank name or rank icon sets, like Psi Operatives, the mod will automatically pick them up and allow you to assign them to different classes.

So, for example, if you want Templars to use Psi Operative rank names and/or rank icons, you can do that. Or assign knight-themed SPARK rank name and rank icon sets to a Paladin class.

You can also toggle which soldier classes count as officers. 

[h1]REQUIREMENTS[/h1]

Safe to add or remove mid-campaign.
[list][*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1134256495][b]X2 WOTC Community Highlander[/b][/url] of any version is required.
[*] [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2550561145][WOTC] Community Promotion Screen[/url][/b] - required.
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=667104300][b][WotC] Mod Config Menu[/b][/url] - optional.[/list]

This mod relies on the Highlander to replace rank names and rank icons, but the interface elements that actually display the soldier ranks must also support that Highlander functionality.

The Community Promotion Screen is currently the only mod that fully supports Cosmetic Rank Replacer on the promotion screen, but some mods can potentially add new interface elements without using the Highlander methods to get soldier rank name and rank icon, and in that case you will see the old ranks in some parts of the game.

[h1]COMPATIBILITY[/h1]

[*] [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2683996590]Long War of the Chosen[/url][/b] - compatible, but the "mark Commanding Officer in Squad Select" feature of my mod will be disabled, as it cannot function reliably in LWOTC environment.
[*] [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1280477867]Musashi's RPG Overhaul[/url][/b] - INCOMPATIBLE.
[*] [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1124609091][WOTC] New Promotion Screen By Default[/url][/b] - INCOMPATIBLE, use Community Promotion Screen instead.[/list]

[h1]COMPANION MODS[/h1]

LWOTC Officers, as well as officers from the mods below, will be automatically picked up by the Rank Replacer and receive the new rank names and rank icons. While this mod is extremely robust and offers unprecedented levels of customization, separating soldier and officer rank names and rank icons is actually its primary intended purpose.

[h1]CONFIGURATION[/h1]

This mod's config folder can be found at:
[code]..\steamapps\workshop\content\268500\2550664377\Config[/code]

If you for some reason don't use MCM, you can configure this mod by hand in [b]XComWOTCIridarOfficersRanks_DEFAULT.ini[/b] file.

New rank icon and rank name sets can be set up through [b]XComRankChanges.ini[/b] and localization files. It also offers more configuration options for determining which soldiers count as officers.

[h1]KNOWN ISSUES[/h1]

Opening the MCM screen for this mod may take a while. The more soldier class mods you have, the longer you have to wait. 

If you have too many soldier class mods, the game may even freeze completely and crash. There are measures in place that are supposed to prevent this from happening, but apparently they don't always work. I will fix this, eventually, but it will require a significant rewrite, so no promises on when that will happen.
